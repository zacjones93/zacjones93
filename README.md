# Hi there 👋

I work at egghead.io helping instructors design educational content that is effective and respects your time. 

If you want to check out some of my work you can look at [egghead-next](https://github.com/eggheadio/egghead-next/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Azacjones93) which is the front end of egghead. 

We are currently using Next.js + TailwindCSS + Sanity.io along with a rails API to power the frontend. The combo has been super awesome to work with. We are able to build stories and curate pages with little friction. This [PR showcases](https://github.com/eggheadio/egghead-next/pull/602) the flexibity and speed that this stack of technology allows.

I'm interested in:

- 🌱  digital gardens
- 🕸️ knowledge graphs
- 💡 design
- 🏋️ training for health and wellness
